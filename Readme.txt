Problem Statement:
	The lack of a viable interface between people who need support and people who can provide it. and
	Unavailability of resources at the time of need when natural disasters occur.

Solution:
	We want to increase the donation for the NGOs for which we are making an app that will collect donations in the form of money, goods(clothing, footwear, blankets), food. As we know maintaining a big staff which will collect all this stuff and distributes honestly is nearly impossible and will have plenty of room for mistakes,that is why we would like to use one of the biggest support structures already established in India. Which are our NGOs these organizations are working from far too long and know what they are doing but their only limitation is Funds.
